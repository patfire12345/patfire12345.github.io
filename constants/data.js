      `I've been programming since I was in the 11th grade. That was a beginner's Python class in high school, but it taught me some of the fundamentals of coding, and more importantly, sparked my passion for software development and web applications.`,
      `After a few internships around different sectors of the Federal Government of Canada, I got to explore different technologies pertaining to both web development and software development.`,
      `Along with my side projects over the years, recently I've been coding in React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, C, and C++.`,
